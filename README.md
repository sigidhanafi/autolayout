# autolayout
I want to refresh my knowledge about autolayout programatically with constrain (pin, alignment, adn stackview)

In this screen, I create title label, wrapped by topcontainer.
topContainer have constrain x = top view, y = middle of view minus size of menu

Then I create middleContainer, that contain two menu. The first menu is about menu, the second is code menu.
These menu have same position, center of the middle container.
